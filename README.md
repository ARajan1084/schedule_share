- **NOTE**: it may take a few extra seconds for the webpage to load for the first time you open it because of Heroku's server resource management
- **NOTE**: when simulating if your friends are busy/free at specific time, the exact start and end time is excluded. For example, if your friend has an class that ends at 5:15, they will be marked 'busy' at 5:14 (and earlier) and 'free' at 5:15 (and later).

ScheduleShare is a REST API app that can:
- Make sharing your schedules with every new classmate you meet extremely easy and fast. All you need is to send a friend request to their username!
- Let you see which of your added friends are busy (currently in class) or free (not currently in class). So, you know which of your friends is currently available for hanging out or group studying.
- Instantly create study groups with all added friends who share classes with you. With one click, you can blast out a study group invitation to all your connections who share a particular class with you. Then, you can do the same for all your classes! (Not on the Heroku Beta Version)
